#Bitcoin Price Detection

This project aims to predict the future price of Bitcoin using historical data on the price of Bitcoin, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page. The project will use two Jupyter notebooks:

prediction.ipynb - This notebook contains the code to predict Bitcoin prices. It will merge and combine the historical data and Wikipedia edit data, then use it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow. The notebook will then switch to an XGBoost model and better predictors to improve accuracy.
sentiment.ipynb - This notebook creates the Wikipedia edit dataset. It will extract data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page, and then store this data in a format that can be used by the prediction notebook.
The project will also develop a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well. The project can be extended to other cryptocurrencies as well.

Here are some of the key benefits of this project:

It can help us to better understand the factors that influence the price of Bitcoin.
It can help us to make more informed decisions about when to buy or sell Bitcoin.
It can help us to develop better strategies for trading Bitcoin.
The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for anyone who is interested in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.
